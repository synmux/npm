Metapackage for Dave Williams.

It's a package. For Dave. By Dave. About Dave. If you were expecting more, well, that's on you.

With thanks - and apologies - to [@zachleat](https://github.com/zachleat).

## Why?

![it is a mystery](assets/mystery.webp)

## Usage

### CLI

```sh
npx dave.io
```

### Programmatic

> For those who want to automate their disappointment.

First, install the package:

```bash
npm install dave.io
```

Then you can pull it in to your heart's content:

```js
import dave from "dave.io";

dave();
```

Or, if you're still clinging to CommonJS:

```js
const { default: dave } = await import("dave.io");

dave();
```

## Development

- Written in **TypeScript**, because more code is more better.
- Built and tested (no, really) with `bun`, because  `npm` and `yarn` don't break enough.
- Linted with `biome`, because someone has to care about code style.
- **For detailed codebase documentation, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)**.

If you want to contribute, ask yourself: why?

## Incoming

Believe it or not, features are planned!

- `--cv` / `-c` parameter to dump out my CV.
- Fetching links (and CV, when implemented) from [my personal API](https://github.com/daveio/syn-horse).
  - There will always be a static fallback.
- Literally anything useful.

## Changelog

- `1.0.1` First release! May angels rejoice.
- `1.0.2` Minor dependency bump and twiddle to remove Node from `engines`.
- `1.0.3` _yanked_
- `1.0.4` _yanked_
- `1.0.5` _yanked_
- `1.0.6` **(current)** Add pronouns to the output and update Docker pins.

## License

MIT.

Because you should be free to do whatever you want with this, including ignoring it entirely.

## Just show me the output

Oh, alright then.
